# Bootcamp Challenge 2 - Portfolio
A portfolio page of projects completed.

## Description 

For this project, a portfolio webpage was created designed for hiring managers. The site had to include:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you.
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications.
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application.
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
